				Fitness is my primary goal because I want to live fit.
				People get sick due to lacking of fitness in their life.
				Evena simple task of getting up early and exercising is 
				daunting to most of the people.
				
				I usually wake up at 6 AM and do a 10 minute workout 
				involving the following exercises.
			</p>
			<ul class = "ulist">
				<li>Jumping Jacks</li>
				<li>Push-ups</li>
				<li>Ab-crunches</li>
				<li>Squats</li>
			</ul>
			<p class = "body maroon b_aqua">
				I hope that these exercises are useful to keep you
				fit and active all the day

			<h3> <strong> <u> 2. Entrepreneurship </u> </strong> </h3> <br>
			<img src = "images/ent.jpg" width = "250" height = "150" title = "Entrepreneur Mind" style = "float:left" /> 
			<p class = "body brown">
				In the world of talented men with jobless life, a
				person who taps the potential of that person is called
				an <em> entrepreneur </em>.
				
				Entrepreneurs are living to find a solution to 
				solve a problem using minimal cost to produce
				maximum efficiency to the society.
				
				A person who can craft a feasible solution to an
				existing problem must consider reading 
				entrepreneurship books.

			<h3 class = "white"> <strong> <u> 3. Relationships </u> </strong> </h3> <br>
			<img src = "images/rela.jpg" width = "250" height = "150" title = "Relationships" style = "float:right" /> 
			<p class = "body white">
				Without stable relatinoships, man is destined for 
				unfortunate death. Relationships build bridges 
				between souls. It exists right from the first breath
				till the last breath.
				
				Relationships offer security to the emotions of
				a man, an intimacy which feels like he's in
				his home. Forging constructive relatinoships
				is the challenge of this decade. 
				
				Highly-successful men value relatinoships more
				than their net worth.
