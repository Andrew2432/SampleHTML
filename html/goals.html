				<p>
					Fitness is my primary goal because I want to live fit.
					People get sick due to lacking of fitness in their life.
					Evena simple task of getting up early and exercising is 
					daunting to most of the people.
					
					I usually wake up at 6 AM and do a 10 minute workout 
					involving the following exercises.
				</p>
				<ul class = "ulist">
					<li>Jumping Jacks</li>
					<li>Push-ups</li>
					<li>Ab-crunches</li>
					<li>Squats</li>
				</ul>
				<p class = "lead">
					I hope that these exercises are useful to keep you
					fit and active all the day

				<p>
					In the world of talented men with jobless life, a
					person who taps the potential of that person is called
					an <em> entrepreneur </em>.
					
					Entrepreneurs are living to find a solution to 
					solve a problem using minimal cost to produce
					maximum efficiency to the society.
					
					A person who can craft a feasible solution to an
					existing problem must consider reading 
					entrepreneurship books.

				<h3> <strong> <u> 3. Relationships </u> </strong> </h3> <br>
				<img src = "images/rela.jpg" width = "250" height = "150" 
				title = "Relationships" style = "float:right" class = "img-responsive" /> 
				<p>
					Without stable relatinoships, man is destined for 
					unfortunate death. Relationships build bridges 
					between souls. It exists right from the first breath
					till the last breath.
					
					Relationships offer security to the emotions of
					a man, an intimacy which feels like he's in
					his home. Forging constructive relatinoships
					is the challenge of this decade. 
					
					Highly-successful men value relatinoships more
					than their net worth.
